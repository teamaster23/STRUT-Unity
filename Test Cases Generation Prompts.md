Please generate some test cases for the following C function. I will provide you a test case example with json format. 
This example is divide into three parts: inputs, outputs, stubs. We use 'expr', 'type' and 'value' key to represent an input 
or output data. In the stubs list, I'll provide the called function signature as well as the called function return value or 
pointer type parameters that the called function may change, and you'll need to decide which data to assign values to 
based on the test case.

Please continue to generate with this format. Satisfy the following requirements.

1. Assign values to the data according to the situation you want to test.
2. Try to cover all branches.
3. Use the stub function to simulate the return value of the called function. I will provide you with all the data that the 
called function may change. It is up to you to decide which values to change in each test.
4. If the same called function is invoked multiple times, list one stubs entry per invocation in execution order.
5. Output legal json format for each test case.
